## Who am I?

I am a Fullstack programmer with a focus on Front-end design and visual content creation.

I have always been intrigued by the world of programming, but I never had the courage to take the leap until I started exploring this field through Python courses and web development with HTML, CSS, and JS after the pandemic.

## What do I do?

Termine recientemente el Bootcamp de FullStack Developer en Henry, y me dedico a realizar proyectos que me permitan avanzar  y crecer en mi formaci√≥n como programador.

## What technologies do I use?

The Henry Bootcamp provided me with the knowledge and experience to enter and grow in the programming world.

The main technologies I work with are:

  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - React.js
  - Redux
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - PostgresSQL
  - Sequelize
  - GIT

I also have knowledge of Illustrator for visual design purposes.
